Trivial Interview "test"

Implement the following function in C++ .
 * “bool F(string s, char ch1, char ch2, int n)”
 * The function determines whether or not there exists an occurrence of ch1 and ch2 
 * separated by a distance of no more than n in the given string s, where s is ascii 
 * and user entered (your function needs to work on any input.) The function must be 
 * efficient and **optimized** for both space and time. Please state what the 
 * complexity of your solution is.
 *
 * Examples:
 * “abcdefg”, ‘b’, ‘d’, 2 --> true
 * “abcdefg”, ‘b’, ‘d’, 20 --> true
 * “abcdefg”, ‘b’, ‘e’, 1 --> false
